# RSA-Encryption-Decryption
Implementation of RSA without the use of any prebuilt functions. The algorithm includes a key generation method, encryption method and a decryption method 

This RSA encryption algorithm with three essential functions - key generation, encryption and decryption. The program prompts the user to enter two prime numbers between 1 and 100, generates and displays the RSA keys. The algorithm then prompts the user to enter a message number between 0 and 256. The program encrypts the message and displays the ciphertext and then decrypts the ciphertext to recover the original message.
The key generation function takes two prime numbers, p and q, computes the modulus n as the product of p and q, and the totient phi(n) as the product of (p-1) and (q-1). The function then chooses a random number e such that 3 < e < phi(n) and gcd(e, phi(n)) = 1, which is the public key. The private key is computed using brute-force to find the multiplicative inverse of e (mod phi(n)). The encryption function takes the message number, public key (n, e), and computes the ciphertext as the message raised to the power of e (mod n). The decryption function takes the ciphertext, private key (n, d), and computes the plaintext as the ciphertext raised to the power of d (mod n). The program uses the BigInteger class in Java to handle large integers, which is required for the RSA algorithm
